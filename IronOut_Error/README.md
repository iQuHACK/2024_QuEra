# IronOut Error - iQuHACK 2024 Challenge Submission

This is IronOut Error's official submission for iQuHACK 2024, with a project from QuEra focused on addressing hard combinatorial optimization problems with neutral atom quantum computing. More specifically, we are focused on finding a path towards quantum advantage in regards to a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem with a disk size of 3 using the Rydberg Blockade effect. 

Our team name is IronOut_Error, and our team members include Thomas Verrill, Rin Kuroda, Aryan Prasad, Galeinston Pham, and Eric Yale Jung.
