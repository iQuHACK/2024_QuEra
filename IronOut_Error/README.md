# IronOut Error - iQuHACK 2024 Challenge Submission

This is IronOut Error's official submission for iQuHACK 2024, with a project from QuEra focused on addressing hard combinatorial optimization problems with neutral atom quantum computing. More specifically, we are focused on finding a path towards quantum advantage in regards to a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem with a disk size of 3 using the Rydberg Blockade effect. 

Our team name is IronOut_Error, and our team members include Thomas Verrill, Rin Kuroda, Aryan Prasad, Galeinston Pham, and Eric Yale Jung. 

The code is as follows: final_code.ipnyb contains all the code that we discuss in our writeup. We also mention 8x8 and 16x16 trials in our presentation; the code for those trials is listed as well. The graph_maker file is programmed in Julia and uses libraries to simulate graphs and graph solutions for evaluating our quantum solutions.
