# Maximally Independent Sets and Rydberg Blockades: A Pathway to Quantum Advantage
> In this project, we use Bloqade, QuEra's neutral atom emulator and SDK running on qBraid platform to examine the Maximaly Independent Set (MIS) problem
>
> ## Description
> MIS is the largest subset of graph G such that each vertice next to each other are not connected by an edge. In our particular problem, we determine the paramenters of quantum adiabatic algorithm of neutral atoms to solve the MIS for a defective square grid of vertices with 30% vertice-drop rate.

## The Problem
Many real-world phenomena can be represented as graph networks, making combinatorial optimization problems involving graphs of paramount importance. Unfortunately, these systems often face combinatorial explosion, where the growth in complexity of computing a solution with additional added nodes makes solutions unfeasible. Quantum algorithms can often exploit novel phenomena that provide a dramatic speedup over classical algorithms. Quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization could prove transformative to many industries and is worth investigating.
